                    <!-- FYI we had to create a separate meetingRoomSlots component because having `meetingRoomInfo` public property in component `meetingRoom` requires that the public property is passed in from the parent component. But in this case, since we are passing in the markup (lightning-tile) WITH all the data it needs we don't have to pass in `meeting-room-info` like we're having to do above. So it seems like the public property set by @api doesn't allow for it to be "optional" (2 Jun 11:17 PM)-->
